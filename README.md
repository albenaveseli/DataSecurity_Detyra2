#  Morse Code Encoder & Decoder – Console App in C#

This project was created as part of the **Data Security** class assignment (2025). It includes **encoding, decoding, and audio playback** of Morse Code using `Console.Beep()` in a console-based C# application.

##  **How to Run the Program**

1. Open the solution in **JetBrains Rider**, **Visual Studio**, or any other C# IDE.
2. Run the program.
3. Follow the instructions in the console:

   -  **Enter a message to encode** – type a word or sentence.
   -  The app encodes it into **Morse code** and displays the result.
   -  Then, it **plays the Morse code** using beeps (`Console.Beep()`).
   -  Next, you can **enter Morse code** manually to decode.
   -  The decoded text will be shown.

## ⚙️ **Technical Implementation Details**

###  **Project Structure**

- `Program.cs` – Entry point of the application. Manages the console UI and user choices (encode, decode, exit).
- `MorseEncoder.cs` – Encodes plain text into Morse Code using the dictionary defined in `MorseMap.cs`.
- `MorseDecoder.cs` – Decodes Morse Code into readable text by reversing the dictionary lookup.
- `MorseMap.cs` – Stores the bidirectional mappings between alphanumeric characters/symbols and their Morse representations.
- `MorsePlayer.cs` – Plays the Morse Code using `Console.Beep()`. Handles timing between dots, dashes, letters, and words.

##  Insights & Highlights

-  **Separation of Concerns**  
  Each core functionality (encoding, decoding, mapping, playback) is implemented in its own class: `MorseEncoder`, `MorseDecoder`, `MorseMap`, and `MorsePlayer`. This modular structure promotes better readability, testing, and maintenance.
 **Bidirectional Mapping**  
  The `MorseMap` class uses a static constructor to automatically generate a reverse mapping from Morse code to characters. This eliminates manual duplication and ensures consistency between encoding and decoding processes.
**Audio Playback Precision**  
  The `MorsePlayer` class handles tone playback using `Console.Beep()` with precise timing:  
  - Dot = 1 unit  
  - Dash = 3 units  
  - Space between letters = 3 units  
  - Space between words ("/") = 7 units

##  **Description of the Morse Code Logic**

###  **Encoding Logic**

- Each letter in your text is **mapped** to its Morse equivalent using a dictionary.
- Spaces between letters are represented by `" "`, and spaces between words by `"/"`.
- The encoded Morse string is built and returned to the user.

###  **Decoding Logic**

- The Morse code input is split by spaces.
- Each symbol or group is matched back to the corresponding alphabet character.
- If `/` is detected, it inserts a space in the decoded message.

## 🔊 **Morse Beep Playback**

The application also includes an audio player using:

```csharp
Console.Beep(frequency, duration);
